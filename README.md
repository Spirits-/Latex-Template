# Latex-Template
My personal LaTeX template hosted here on Github for easier sharing. Because Latex is obtuse and often difficult to use, I've tried to comment code as much as possible to clear up its purpose.

## Fonts used: 
* Main & Math digits: Charis SIL
* Math: STIX Two Math
* Sans Serif: Helvetica Now
