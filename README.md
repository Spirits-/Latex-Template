# Latex-Template
My personal LaTeX template hosted here on Github for easier sharing.

## Fonts used: 
* Main body & Math (where applicable): Charis SIL
* Titles: Helvetica Now Display (Bold)
* Greek: Gentium Plus

Gentium and Charis can be found inthe `fonts` folder. Helvetica Now is a commercial font which I cannot distribute for free.

## Known Issues

* Latex ignores the Gentium font for special symbols made out of greek characters like `\sum`.
